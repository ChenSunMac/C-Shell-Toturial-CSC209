```c
/*
 * pipe-example.c - an example of creating a pipeline between two processes.
 *
 * This program arranges the execution of the command "ls | tr e f".
 *
 * This program outputs some stuff before and after to show that the main
 * program persists, as one would like a shell to persist after executing
 * a command.  If I were writing this normally, I wouldn't bother to keep the
 * main program around, I'd make it exec tr directly without forking first.
 * But if we were writing a shell, it would have to loop around at that
 * point to print another prompt.
 *
 * Actually we wouldn't write the following at all.  We'd normally just write
 * system("ls | tr e f").  This does the initial fork and then execs sh, the
 * shell, to parse that command-line and do the other forking and pipe
 * creation and execing and stuff.  But of course someone has to write
 * *that* code, in the shell, and in CSC 209 we learn how it works.
 * So here is how it works.
 *
 * There are man pages for all of the kernel calls below, and the man pages
 * are highly recommended.  In the "Unix Programmer's Manual" (man pages),
 * volume 2 is kernel calls.
