**1.** Consider the C program below which produces the output:
```
Even positions are 0246 and odd positions are 1357
Even positions are ACE and odd positions are BD
```
Complete the function parity strings as described in the function comment. Your program should generate this output without making any changes to main. Your function must not change parameter *s*.
