# Virtual Memory

**Virtual Memory** \(also virtual storage\) is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine".

The aim of this technique is to make efficient use of both the CPU and RAM (physical memory).
也就是说利用这种技术，可以计算机可以有较之物理空间“看上去更大的空间”，所以才叫**Virtual** Memory
