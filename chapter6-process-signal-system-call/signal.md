# Signal Concepts
A signal is a notification to a process that an event has occurred. Signals are sometimes described as software interrupts. Signals are analogous to hardware interrupts
in that they interrupt the normal flow of execution of a program; in most cases, it is not possible to predict exactly when a signal will arrive.
